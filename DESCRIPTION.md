# :herb: Attari ‚Äî AI Traditional Remedy Analyzer

> **‚ÄúKnow your remedy ‚Äî safe, local, and evidence-backed.‚Äù**
> Bridging Moroccan ancestral medicine with modern AI insight.

---

## :stethoscope: Overview

**Genba** is an AI-powered platform that analyzes Moroccan **traditional remedies** (herbal mixtures, oils, home recipes) to ensure **safety, scientific validation, and awareness**.

Users can type or photograph a remedy, and Genba identifies ingredients, checks for **toxicity or drug interactions**, and explains the **scientific background** of each component ‚Äî all in **Darija, Arabic, or French**.

This project aims to bridge **ancestral Moroccan healing wisdom** with **modern artificial intelligence**, empowering people to make safe, informed health decisions.

## :warning: Problem Statement

Traditional medicine is deeply embedded in Moroccan culture. However:

* Many people rely on **oral traditions** or **social media recipes** without medical validation.
* Herbal mixtures can be **unsafe**, cause **toxic reactions**, or **interact dangerously** with pharmaceuticals.
* There is **no unified digital resource** that bridges **traditional Moroccan remedies** with **modern medical science**.

### :flag_ma: Local Context

* Over 60% of Moroccans use traditional remedies regularly.
* Reports of poisoning and allergic reactions have been increasing.
* Health literacy and access to professional advice are limited in many rural areas.
